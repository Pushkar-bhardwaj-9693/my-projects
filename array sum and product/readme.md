# Sum and Product Calculator  

This project prompts the user to enter a number, generates an array from 1 to the input number, and calculates both the sum and product of the numbers in the array.  

## How It Works  
- Enter a number when prompted.  
- The program creates a list of numbers from 1 to your input.

## Example  
If you enter `5` as input:  
Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
The sum of the numbers is 15
The product of the numbers is 120
